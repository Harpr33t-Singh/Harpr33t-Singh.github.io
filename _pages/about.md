![My journey](/images/about.jpg){: .align-right width="250 px"}
I am electrochemist with strong expertise in synthesis, In-situ characterization of materials (nanomaterials/2D materials) and system develompent such as electrochemical systems, sensors and devices.

# Work Experience
## Doctoral Research ( Sept. 2021 - Present)
Throughout my professional journey, I've been deeply immersed in the development of MXene-based actuators, with a primary focus on achieving control over interlayer spacing through targeted modifications in surface chemistry and hybridization techniques. My work involved extensive utilization of advanced in-situ analysis methods, such as scanning electrochemistry combined with Raman spectroscopy, atomic force measurements (AFM), scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), and impedance measurements. These techniques provided invaluable insights into the material's characteristics, allowing for the fine-tuning of actuation behavior through the integration of customized functional groups. Moreover, a significant aspect of my role has been the design and fabrication of asymmetric actuators employing gel electrolytes. This involved tailoring the configuration of these actuators through sophisticated techniques like shaping, patterning, and strain engineering, with a potential integration of 3D printing technology utilizing MXene inks.
My expertise in material synthesis, particularly with MXenes, as well as proficiency in functionalization and processing techniques, has been pivotal in driving these endeavors forward. Additionally, my adeptness in device handling, programming, and a profound understanding of electrochemical methods for in-situ analysis have been instrumental in engineering electrode designs using 3D printing, all aimed at optimizing performance outcomes effectively.

## Junior Research Fellow (Nov. 2019 - July 2021)

During my tenure as a Junior Research Fellow at the Centre for Biomedical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), New Delhi, I concentrated on fabricating standalone microfluidic devices for real-time multi-analyte detection. My primary focus was on enhancing production efficiency by refining microfluidic chip design skills using photolithography and CO2 laser engraving techniques. 
By leveraging my expertise in circuits and sensors, I spearheaded the development of portable systems tailored for real-time analyte analysis and quantification. This involved integrating microfluidic chips into compact and versatile platforms capable of providing instantaneous feedback on multiple analytes simultaneously. My role in this project encompassed both technical innovation and practical implementation, aiming to address pressing challenges in biomedical engineering research.

## Research Assistant (Aug. 2018 - May 2019)

Before my tenure at IIT, I interned at IMEC's Advanced Patterning Group in Leuven, Belgium, where I focused on studying cross-linking type EUV-resist platforms to enhance lithography for high-volume manufacturing. Throughout this internship, I developed proficiency in handling thin films and conducting analyses using spectroscopy and chromatography techniques. These skills contributed to ongoing efforts to refine EUV lithography processes, aiming to advance semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.

## Master's Thesis (Aug. 2017 - June 2018)

In my master's thesis, I investigated the catalytic potential of MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). This involved hands-on experience with material handling and wet chemistry techniques, coupled with analytical and electrochemical analysis methods. Through synthesizing and characterizing these heterostructures, I gained insights into their catalytic activity for HER. This research contributes to the broader understanding of transition metal dichalcogenide-based catalysts and holds promise for advancing sustainable energy technologies by providing efficient solutions for hydrogen evolution.

## Bachelor's Thesis (Jan 2015 - June 2015)

Throughout my bachelor's thesis project, I acquired skills in managing data acquisition systems and constructing predictive models aimed at early forecasting of crop disease severity. This initiative serves to assist farmers in optimizing pesticide usage for more efficient pest control measures.
