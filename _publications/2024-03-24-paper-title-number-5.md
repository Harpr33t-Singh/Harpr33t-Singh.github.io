Electrocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen using semiconducting heterogeneous nanostructures is a promising and emerging technology. Semiconductor materials based heterogeneous nanostructures have attracted much attention to be used as catalysts, co-catalysts, photocatalysts and photo absorbers. The present work deals with the investigation of heterostructures of molybdenum selenide (MoSe<sub>2</sub>) and tungsten selenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) nanosheets prepared through liquid exfoliation method as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our experimental studies reveal that MoSe<sub>2</sub>/WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures synthesized using hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) exhibits superior HER performance. These novel structures leads to the exposure of more catalytically active sites and maintains effective electron transport, resulting in a small Tafel slope of 80â€¯mV/decay and large electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of 87. This low-cost method finds application in high-performance HER electrocatalyst.
