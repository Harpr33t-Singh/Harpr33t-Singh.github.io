collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for low-voltage electrochemical actuators (ECAs) due to its excellent electrical conductivity, volumetric capacitance, and mechanical properties. However, its in-plane actuation is limited to little intralayer strain of MXene sheets under polarization. Here it is demonstrated that a simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA) functionalization of MXene improves the in-plane actuation strain by 337% and also enhances the mechanical property and stability in air and the electrolyte. Various in situ characterizations reveal that the improved actuation is ascribed to the co-insertion/desertion of TBA and Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter-edge gaps that causes a large in-plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations. The assembled bending actuator has a high strength and modulus and generates a peak-to-peak strain difference of 0.771% and a blocking force up to 51.5 times its own weight under 1 V. The designed soft robotic tweezer can grasp an object under 1 V and hold it firmly under 0 V. The novel sheet sliding mechanism resembling the filament sliding theory in skeletal muscles may inspire the design of high-performance actuators with other nanomaterials.'
