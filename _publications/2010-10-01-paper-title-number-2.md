Since the advent of biosensors for rapid analytical applications and use of micro fabrication technology for their miniaturization, science has come a long way in addressing the requirements for multiplexing, reusability and automation required for multianalyte biosensing. Though, microfluidic device fabrication has become more or less a standard technique nowadays, it is often tricky to immobilize the bio recognition element onto them after device assembly. For example glass-PDMS based microfluidic devices needs to be bonded using oxygen plasma or UV-ozone. Therefore, biomolecules, such as enzymes, antibodies etc. cannot be immobilized prior to device bonding. In this chapter, we shall put special emphasis on such critical immobilization procedures, while we shall also discuss the methods of their stabilization for the sake of enhanced shelf-life and reusability. Our discussions shall be based also on lateral flow immuno-devices and other paper microfluidic devices apart from glass-glass, glass-PDMS, PMMA-PMMA, Si-wafers and other combinations.
