The main idea of this paper is to present PLC based data acquisition system for plant disease information to the farmers [4]. The objective of this paper is to develop a predictive model for early forecasting of disease severity for Picrorhiza kurroa and Apple with optimum efficiency, which help to farmers for management and control of use of pesticides to reduce the loss in economical cost and also beneficial to the environment and human health. Firstly, we measure different parameters like temperature, humidity, leaf wetness, solar radiations etc. by use of different sensors. The output analogous signal is applied to the PLC system for data processing by use of predefined mathematical model. The System can detect the small fluctuations in parameters and compare it with past data values to make a decision. PLC uses a different type of programming like ladder, Boolean, Grafcet for implementing a mathematical model [2]. Due to which we will have a complete understanding of the environmental conditions of Apple and Picrorhiza kurroa farms and we would thus able to control these conditions. By use of this data, we can also implement such automatic systems which detect the symptoms of disease at starting stage and perform an action accordingly and spray the pesticides in a control manner without interaction of human [3]. By correlating the plant indices we can provide a valuable information to farmers for improving quality and quantity of crops.
